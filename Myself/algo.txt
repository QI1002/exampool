  > terminal node (leaf node) as external node
  > non-terminal node as internal node
  > full binary tree or balanced binary tree (the depth of leaf nodes are x or x+1)
  > complete binary tree (the depth of leaf nodes are x)
  > traversal order: preorder:(p,l,r), inorder:(l,p,r), postorder:(l,r,p) (inorder name from math expr, ex: 2+3)
                    and level-order traversal 
    - easy to implement preorder by stack and level-order by queue  
  > recursive => remove it 
                 1. one call one : change to use loop replace it
                 2. one call X (X>1): easy to change to use one call X-1 with loop
                 3. use one stack (ex: tree preorder traversal)
                 4. use two stack (ex: tree postorder traversal)

TODO: 
[1]. check the tree traverse implementation of inorder and postorder

		   BestO AvgO  WorseO Memory Stable Compare Swap    Note  	                 
Selection Sort     N^2	 N^2   N^2    1      No     N^2/2   N       better for large data but small key 
Insertion Sort     N	 N^2   N^2    1      Yes    N^2/4   N^2/8   linear for a sorted data but more assignment
Bubble Sort        N     N^2   N^2    1      Yes    N^2/2   N^2/2   linear for a sorted data but more swaps

Quick Sort         NlogN NlogN N^2    logN   No     2NlogN  N/3logN 
Heap Sort                NlogN NlogN  1      No     2NlogN
Merge Sort         NlogN NlogN NlogN  N      Yes    NlogN

Shell Sort         NlogN -     -      -      No     N^(3/2)         use insertion sort hierarchically (steps = /3)
MSB Radix Sort     -     n*k/d n*k/d  n+s^d  Yes                    recursive (k = key bits, d = division bits) 
LSB Radix Sort     -     n*k/d n*k/d  n+s^d  Yes                    no recursive and reply on stable character
External Sort                                                       multiple way merge sort

TODO: 
1. why selection is not stable, why stable need O(n) extra space ?
   the swap make instable and we can use insert to replace swap and then stable
{2}. review the quicksort and heapsort algorithm
